1.2,2,[28],What stages in the software life cycle are influenced by the testing stage?,The testing stage can influence both the coding stage (phase 5) and the solution refinement stage (phase 7),Testing could affect all parts of the life cycle, it could make you go back <br><br>to specification if it does not test well.

1.3,4.5,[6], What are the main advantages associated with object-oriented programming?,Abstraction and reusability.,"Modularability, the ability to reuse parts of the program later in another program sometimes with completely different goals for the program. Also it makes it easier to debug code by dividing up the code into classes that each do a specific job and when the program fails at one job you only have one class to debug. Good for security purposes because it allows you to let someone use a program which sorts lists without having to give them access to the source code. ALso allows you to use inheritance and polymorphism.",
1.3,5,[5], What are the main advantages associated with object-oriented programming?,Abstraction and reusability.,"This type of programming is more flexible, making it easier to add and modify the program.  It is also a type of a fail safe program, you check each individual module.  This eliminates redundant code and makes the program easier to read for other programmers.  When debugging the program it is easier to track down the source of a problem within a module rather than a 2 million line program.",

1.6,4.5,[15],Where are variables declared in a C++ program?,Variables can be declared anywhere in a program. They can be declared inside a function (local variables) or outside the functions (global variables),"anywhere, but where you declare them depends on where you want them to be accessible (their scope)",
1.6,4.5,[14],Where are variables declared in a C++ program?,Variables can be declared anywhere in a program. They can be declared inside a function (local variables) or outside the functions (global variables),It depends if itÃƒÂ¢?Â¬Ã¢?žÂ¢s a global then they have to be declared out side the source code to be used in every scope however a local variable is one declared in a local function etc. which obviously doesnÃƒÂ¢?Â¬Ã¢?žÂ¢t need to be declared outside the variable seeing how it is used for the function or block its being called for. ,
