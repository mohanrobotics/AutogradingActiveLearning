1.3,4.5,[6], What are the main advantages associated with object-oriented programming?,Abstraction and reusability.,"Modularability, the ability to reuse parts of the program later in another program sometimes with completely different goals for the program. Also it makes it easier to debug code by dividing up the code into classes that each do a specific job and when the program fails at one job you only have one class to debug.
