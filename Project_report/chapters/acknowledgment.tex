        This project would not have been complete without the help and constructive inputs from our supervisors. We want to thank Prof. Dr. Paul G. Pl{\"o}ger for providing us with an opportunity to work on this project and guiding us. We wish to extend our gratitude to M. Sc. Deebul Nair for his invaluable suggestions and comments during the weekly meetings throughout this project. 
        
        We thank Rubanraj Ravichandran for assisting us during the development of the web-based graphical user interface(GUI) for our grading system. The support provided by Ramesh Kumar by providing us with the implementations from his research and development project was beneficial and saved our time for which we are thankful. We would also like to thank Senthilkumar Kathiresan and Naresh Kumar Gurulingan for helping us with setting up the college cluster and for their valuable comments.
        
        The survey done by Dr. Burr Settles on Active Learning, and the active learning framework (modAL) by Dr. Tivadar Danka helped us to incorporate active learning for the task of short answer grading.
        
        Finally, we would like to extend our gratitude to our family and friends whose love and moral support helped us in steering this project at the right pace.
