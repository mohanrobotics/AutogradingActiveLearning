  \field{abstract}{%
  Abstract Automatic short answer grading (ASAG) is the task of assessing short
  nat- ural language responses to objective questions using computational
  methods. The active research in this field has increased enormously of late
  with over 80 papers fit- ting a definition of ASAG. However, the past efforts
  have generally been ad-hoc and non-comparable until recently, hence the need
  for a unified view of the whole field. The goal of this paper is to address
  this aim with a comprehensive review of ASAG research and systems according
  to history and components. Our historical analysis identifies 35 ASAG systems
  within 5 temporal themes that mark advancement in methodology or evaluation.
  In contrast, our component analysis reviews 6 common dimensions from
  preprocessing to effectiveness. A key conclusion is that an era of evaluation
  is the newest trend in ASAG research, which is paving the way for the
  consolidation of the field.%

  \field{abstract}{%
  The key idea behind active learning is that a machine learning algorithm can
  achieve greater accuracy with fewer training labels if it is allowed to
  choose the data from which it learns. An active learner may pose queries,
  usually in the form of unlabeled data instances to be labeled by an oracle
  (e.g., a human annotator). Active learning is well-motivated in many modern
  machine learning problems, where unlabeled data may be abundant or easily
  obtained, but labels are difficult, time-consuming, or expensive to obtain.
  This report provides a general introduction to active learning and a survey
  of the literature. This includes a discussion of the scenarios in which
  queries can be formulated, and an overview of the query strategy frameworks
  proposed in the literature to date. An analysis of the empirical and
  theoretical evidence for successful active learning, a summary of problem
  setting variants and practical issues, and a discussion of related topics in
  machine learning research are also presented.%

  We present a fast, simple, and high-accuracy short answer grading system.
  Given a short-answer question and its correct answer, key measures of the
  correctness of a student re-sponse can be derived from its semantic
  sim-ilarity with the correct answer. Our super-vised model (1) utilizes
  recent advances in the identification of short-text similarity, and (2)
  augments text similarity features with key grading-specific constructs. We
  present exper-imental results where our model demonstrates top performance on
  multiple benchmarks.%
